### Intro to python code 

Note for andy: <br>
I'm going to leave the more basic examples as jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) because I like the inline format of the code & figures. For examples that you would want to run yourself, I'll put them in as a .py file. 

* Dataframe_examples.ipynb: basic dataframe functions (ie subsetting, plotting, etc) 
* INTRO_data_formats.ipynb: examples of working with the same data in different datatypes (netcdf, dataframe, and array). This one is very basic.
